* Once installed and activated; start a new post/page.
* In the post where you want to make a section usually **h2** tag, write like this, **[toccon id="first" title="My first Section"]**. You may add as many section as you want.
* If you want a sub section under any section, write this **[toccon id="first" sub="first_sub" title="My first sub section under first"]**
* You may go one more step deep like **[toccon id="first" sub="first_sub" sub2="second_sub" title="My sub sub section"]**
* Now just place [toc] tag where you want the TOC to show. Usually at the begining of of the post.
